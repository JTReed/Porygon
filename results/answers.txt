Q2: 
Latency: I predict that to ping from h1 to h4, which will pass through switch links 	L1, L2, and L3, it will take sum of the individual pings for those links. 
	- 80ms + 20ms + 81ms = 181ms average rtt

Q3:
Latency: I predict that ping time will end up being slightly higher than if only one host was requesting a ping back due to any waiting that has to happen. Also, there is a chance that some packets may be dropped.
- Trial 1
	- h1->h4: sent=20 received=20 lost=0% rtt min/avg/max=180/181/190ms
	- h8->h4: sent=20 received=20 lost=0% rtt min/avg/max=180/182/196ms
	* No packets were dropped as the server returns packets immediately with no downtime to extend past the 1s timeout period.  h8 was started a fraction of a second after h1, so I assume that the 1ms longer time is due to having to wait for the server to return h1's packet first. Since the packets are so small, I can't imagine that much collision would happen due to bandwidth constraints.
- Trial 2
	- h7->h9: sent=20 received=20 lost=0% rtt min/avg/max=180/181/190ms
	- h8->h9: sent=20 received=20 lost=0% rtt min/avg/max=180/182/192ms
	* Again, the server started 2nd takes a tiny fraction of time longer
- Trial 3
	- h4->h1: sent=20 received=20 lost=0% rtt min/avg/max=180/181/191ms
	- h9->h1: sent=20 received=20 lost=0% rtt min/avg/max=180/182/194ms
	* Still same results - pretty much expected speed + a ms for the 2nd client
- trial 4
	- h10->h7: sent=20 received=20 lost=0% rtt min/avg/max=180/182/197ms
	- h9->h7:  sent=20 received=20 lost=0% rtt min/avg/max=180/183/202ms
	* This one was on average 1ms slower than the others, but still followed the "+1 ms for the second server" rule we've been seeing

Q4:
Latency: I predict a combination between the last two problems. General time will be determined by the time it takes to ping over all the paths, but since two will be using the path L2, that time will be a little longer than expected. So instead of 181ms and 41 ms, I expect to see something like 182ms and 42ms.
* The values weren't changed much at all. L2 is a pretty small-delay link (20ms), so that could potentially have to do with it? Not much congestion to bog stuff down.
